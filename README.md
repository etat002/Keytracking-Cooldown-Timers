# Keytracking-Cooldown-Timers 
A C++ based code that uses the Windows API to create minimal pop-up windows that overlay over whatever processes, without taking up focus, and notify the user that a certain time has pass since certain keys.
Original purpose is to keep track of certain skills and tell the user the key is off cooldown in a variety of games, such as Maplestory.
